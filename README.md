# rot13-for-alfred3
Simple rot13 text cipher implementation for Alfred 3 with active ciphering. Requires the Alfred Powerpack to use. I made this because I was tired of visiting http://rot13.com.

Keyword for 'sending' is "r13" (you can adjust this easily in [Alfred Preferences] -> [Workflows] -> [rot13] -> [double click on the script filter] -> [Keyword]). Keyword for 'receiving' is "r13l".

With "r13", action the item (usually the Enter key) to copy the ciphered text to your keyboard. With "r13l", action the item to display the ciphered text as large text.
