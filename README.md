# rot13-for-alfred3
Simple rot13 text cipher implementation for Alfred 3 with active ciphering. Requires the Alfred Powerpack to use. I made this because I was tired of visiting http://rot13.com.

Keyword is "r13" (you can adjust this easily in [Alfred Preferences] -> [Workflows] -> [rot13] -> [double click on the script filter] -> [Keyword])

Action the item (usually the Enter key) to copy the ciphered text to your keyboard. You can view long results by pressing âŒ˜L by default.
